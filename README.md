- 💻 Software engineer who treats **backend engineering** and **testing** like an extreme sport  
- 🐍🦫 Fluent in **Python** (snake charming) & **Go** (gopher whispering)  
- ⚙️ Collector of paradigms: OOP (objects in neat boxes), functional (functions as first-class citizens), imperative (bossy code), declarative (code that vibes)  
- 🚀 Builder of APIs so reliable they could survive a cosmic storm, and systems so well-tested they'd pass a lie detector
